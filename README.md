**Dark Matter** is a small [LibGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) autoscroll survival game for android and desktop.
It was generated with [gdx-liftoff](https://github.com/tommyettinger/gdx-liftoff). It is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and uses
the [LibKTX](https://github.com/libktx/ktx) extensions for libgdx.

The code and the project is explained in a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aa6CY7_j9U&list=PLTKHCDn5RKK-8lZmjZoG4rFywN_SLbZR8) on my [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/Quillraven) channel.

In **Dark Matter** you control a spaceship that horizontally follows the mouse cursor or finger on android. The goal
is to survive as long as possible. The dark matter area at the bottom of the screen slowly sucks you in and once you are
inside its area you will take damage.

To survive you can collect different power-ups that are falling from the top of the screen:
- Two different speed boost
- Life gain
- Shield gain
